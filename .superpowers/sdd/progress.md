# Progress ledger — RabbitMQ visualizer

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-05-rabbitmq-visualizer.md
Branch: feat/rabbitmq-visualizer

Task 1: complete (commits eaf3421..998cea1, review clean after fix pass)

Task 2: complete (commits fbb7f2a..8606f77, review clean after fix pass — purity guard widened to 14 patterns, tsconfig.test.json isolates node types)

Task 3: complete (commit b7adf38, review clean, heap fuzzed at depth with ties)

Task 4: complete (commits d57a53f..96aabee, review clean after fix pass — headers vacuous-match bug was a plan defect, corrected in plan too)

## Open notes (carry to final review)
- Minor: two zustand versions installed — top-level zustand@5 plus zustand@4.5.7 nested under @xyflow/react@12. Two instances in one tree can cause state-sharing bugs. Watch during Task 11 (store) and Task 12 (canvas).
- Root tsconfig.json is references-only. Bare `tsc --noEmit` is a silent no-op; use `npm run typecheck` (tsc -b).
- Reviewer flagged the implementer's "documented fallback" claim as false attribution. Adjudicated: NOT a defect — the temp-subdir fallback was in the controller's dispatch prompt, which the reviewer could not see.
- Minor (Task 3, deferred): `pushAll` in src/engine/clock.ts has no dedicated unit test. Task 9 uses it heavily — fold a test into Task 9 rather than a separate fix cycle.
